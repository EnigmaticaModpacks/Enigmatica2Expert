**Enigmatica 2: Expert - Extended** is an addon for [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert)

The aim of the addon is to make `E2E` even **more interesting** and **challenging**. Balance it out as much as possible, but leave the most interesting stuff untouched.

## Mods

Here are `+200` up-to-date 1.12.2 mods (about 400 total). Despite this, the modpack **only takes 30% longer** to load than the original E2E. And the **FPS** in the game is **even higher**.

10+ additional major mods and +200 tweaking and Quality of Life addons. Most important of them:

- ❤️ `Scaling Health`
- 🛡️ `Construct's Armory`
- ⛏️ `Harder Branch Mining`
- 🍱 `Little Tiles`
- 🐀 `Rats`
- 🐉 `Tinker's Evolution`

See full list in [MODS.md](MODS.md)

## Principles

- ### No OP items. No exploits. Less cheese  

  No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  Work towards crafting the powerful items, or use less powerful alternatives.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9z "Angel Ring") The Angel Ring is harder to give way to all other flight options.*  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv92 "Terrasteel") Сan no longer be easily cheesed through the mob stripping farm..*

- ### Less miners -> more manual mining + processing  

  *![](https://git.io/JOv90 "Sieve") Gave you Stack/Second of ore. Got nerf. But new x7 ore processing line comes in.*

- ### Tinker's Hegemony  

  Material balance was reworked, OP traits remapped. Mobs spawn with random TCon's weapons.  
  *![](https://git.io/JGncx "Osgloglas") Is no longer the only correct option.*

- ### More adventuring  

  Better caves, additional structures, more loot, reworked planets.  
  *![](https://git.io/Jze1z "Rocket Assembling Machine") Added a variety of new resources and unique terrain on planets and other dimensions.*

- ### Clear guide  

  Quests and recipes reveal unpopular "hidden" mechanics  
  *![](https://git.io/JtJMc "Book") More Quest chapters describing "forgotten" items*

- ### Less Strict  

  Tedious recipes and whole branches of mods **can be skipped** with alternate recipes.  
  **Exploration is optional** - you can finish the modpack without even going into Twilight Forest.  
  *![](https://is.gd/tWaivc "Gaia Spirit") You don't want to sweat killing the Gaia Guardian? Just skip it.*

-----------------

## Installation

### From Curse Forge

Just use *New Instance* feature of your launcher. [GDLauncher example](https://i.imgur.com/1KV7r6T.png).

### Manual installation

1. Download `E2E-Extended_{version}.zip` from Assets of [latest release](https://github.com/Krutoy242/Enigmatica2Expert-Extended/releases) *OR* from [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica-2-expert-extended).
2. Use *Import* feature in your luncher.

### Skyblock 🌌

When you creating new world, there is Skyblock option. You can play it without preparation, but with standard settings, structures will be generated in an void world. It is desirable (but not necessary) to turn them off.

Download and overwrite [this configs](https://github.com/Krutoy242/Enigmatica2Expert-Extended/tree/master/dev/skyblock_overrides) over your installed instance.  
New configs would disable some generation in void world, like Slime Islands or Dragon corpses.  
If you play on a server on which have already made these changes, the client does not need to change the configs.

-----------------

## Developing strategy

This is unofficial addon and not supported with **Enigmatica** dev team.

Some of the changes from the `-Extended` version [[1]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1926)[[2]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1773)[[3]](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/pull/1577) were added to the main modpack as well, so I became a [contributor](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks/Enigmatica2Expert/graphs/contributors).
