 IMPORTANT:
  This is the core recipe file. Modifying this file will have no effect. It will be rewritten by EnderIO and all
  modifications made to it will be lost. To add or modify sources please use 'PainterPaintSources_User.xml'.

  This file is used to create a white list and black list for items that can be used as paint sources in the painting
  machine. Each entry in the lists describes an item stack. This stack must be for a block item (i.e. and item that can
  be placed in the world as a block). If an item is is not in either list then the default checks are used. For details
  on the format of item stack definitions see SAGMillRecipes_Core.xml.

  The contents of this file will be merged with the contents of 'PainterPaintSources_User.xml'. To remove an entry
  contained in this file simply include an identical entry in the user file with the added attribute 'remove=true'. For
  example, to remove Silverwood planks from the whitelist, the user file would contain this:

  <PainterPaintSources>
    <whitelist>
      <itemStack modID="thaumcraft" itemName="block_wooden_device" itemMeta="6" remove="true" />
    </whitelist>
  </PainterPaintSources>

<PainterPaintSources>

  <whitelist>
  </whitelist>

  <blacklist>
  </blacklist>

</PainterPaintSources>
