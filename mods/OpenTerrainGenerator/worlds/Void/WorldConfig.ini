WorldPackerModName: 

# What OpenTerrainGenerator does with the config files.
# Possible modes:
#    WriteAll - default
#    WriteWithoutComments - write config files without help comments
#    WriteDisable - doesn't write to the config files, it only reads. Doesn't auto-update the configs. Use with care!

# NOTE: This is a legacy setting and is only used for OTG worlds created with 1.12.2 v6 or lower.
# For 1.12.2 v6 or higher, OTG reads all biomes in the BiomeConfigs directory and assigns biome id's.
# You need to register your custom biomes here. This setting will make Open Terrain Generator
# generate setting files for them. However, it won't place them in the world automatically.
# See the settings for your BiomeMode below on how to add them to the world.

# Syntax: CustomBiomes:BiomeName:id[,AnotherBiomeName:id[,...]]
# Example: CustomBiomes:TestBiome1:30,BiomeTest2:31
# This will add two biomes and generate the BiomeConfigs for them.
# All changes here need a server restart.

# Due to the way Mojang's loading code works, all biome ids need to be unique
# on the server. If you don't do this, the client will display the biomes just fine,
# but the server can think it is another biome with the same id. This will cause saplings,
# snowfall and mobs to work as in the other biome.

# The available ids range from 0 to 1023 and the ids 0-39 and 127-167 are taken by vanilla.
# The ids 256-1023 cannot be saved to the map files, so use ReplaceToBiomeName in that biome.

# A double value representing the Y value relative to the top of the map at which void fog is at its maximum. The default factor of 0.03125 relative to 256, for example, means the void fog will be at its maximum at (256*0.03125), or 8.
VoidFogYFactor: 0.03125

# A value above 0.0, defaults to 0.08. Affects entities jumping and falling. 0.04 would result in half the gravity and falling damage.
# NOTE: Broken for Forge 1.11.2 MP atm, should work fine for SP and 1.12.2 SP & MP.
GravityFactor: 0.08

# The dimension's movement factor. Whenever a player or entity changes dimension from world A to world B, their coordinates are multiplied by worldA.provider.getMovementFactor() / worldB.provider.getMovementFactor(). Example: Overworld factor is 1, nether factor is 8. Traveling from overworld to nether multiplies coordinates by 1/8.
