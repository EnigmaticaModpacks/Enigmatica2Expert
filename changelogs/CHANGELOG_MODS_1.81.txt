			Updated 'block placement' logic through the entire mod, so things like building scepters and machines place blocks and keep their NBT data (like shulker boxes) as well as relative player directions, also improved compatibility with any blocks having special onItemUse logic/metadata.
			Workbench now quickly and cleanly syncs between multiple players using it at the same time.
			Excavate no longer allows tools to go into negative durability (correctly uses native attemptDamageItem to handle unbreaking enchant, tool damage, and tool breaking).
			GPS Marker now stores specific location of the hit within the block, the players facing direction, and the block-face clicked on (shows on tooltip while holding sneak)
			Structure Builder GUI changed, removed offset sliders and replaced with GPS slot; removed rotations value.
			Structure builder now optionally uses the GPS markers, so you can target an offset location and set the orientation of rotating blocks such as stairs.
			Structure builder Diagonal setting now uses size to build across just like a roof.
			Structure builder has a new Horizontal Cylander building mode.
			Renamed Cyclic building scepter to Ranged Building Scepter; it now renders an outline of the distant block that it will place.

			Ender Library now saves its data when picked up and placed down as an item, for safe transport like a shulker box.
			Fixed Model Variant Exceptions showing in log file.
			Fixed water candle sometimes spawning mobs in the ground or creating other duplicate blocks.
			All dynamyte now uses ExplosionEvent.Start event to allow other mods to hook and cancel explosions if needed.
			Piston Scepter: removed rotate mode (wooden wrench does exactly this); Piston scepter now pushes a whole line of blocks not just one, matching real piston behavior; also it checks canPlayerMove for permission hooks.
			Ender Library now checks for enchanted books of stack size != 1 for mod compatibility.
			Improve Storage Bag button tooltips for useability.
			Storage Bag deposit updated to use capabilities (more compatible with more modded inventories for example AA Crates).
