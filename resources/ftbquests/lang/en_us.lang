Note that the larger the blast radius, the larger the blast radius of the thermonuclear bomb will be.\n\n§9Step 2:§r Place a column of three thermonuclear bomb cores above the nuclear bomb. They must all be vertically aligned, so that the plutonium rods within them connect.\n\n§9Step 3:§r Surround the thermonuclear cores with a "tamper" made of reflective, fissionable, or salting blocks. Reflective blocks are effectively inert, and only increase the explosion power by a little bit. Fissionable blocks greatly amplify the explosion. Salting blocks will absorb some of the explosion's energy, and convert it into extremely radioactive fallout.\n\n§9Step 4:§r Link the nuclear detonator to the nuclear bomb and detonate it.

A higher efficiency §6increases§r the amount of particles in the output particle stacks, although the amount may never be higher than that stated in §2JEI§f. \n\nDetectors are primarily useful for Collision Chamber recipes with §cvery low cross-sections§r, especially the §6high-energy§f collisions. More details on the amount calculation for output particle stacks and efficiency can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki§f.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.decelerator.name=Decelerator
q.nuclearcraft_overh.decelerator.desc=§3Decelerators§f lower the energy of particles that go in them to a minimum of §60eV§r. This is especially useful for creating §5antimatter compounds§r and §6exotic matter§r in §7Neutral Exotic Containment§r.\n\n\n§nConstruction§r\n\nA visualisation of a §3Decelerators§f can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki.§f \n\nDecelerators are built in the exact same way as Synchrotrons, with three notable differences:\n\n1. They require a §7Decelerator Controller.§f\n2. They cannot have §7Synchrotron Ports§f installed.§f\n3. Only one §dRF Cavity§f is required; any more than one serves no purpose and wastes power.\n\n\n§nRequirements§r\n\nA Decelerator has the same requirements as any other Accelerator, requring §6power§r, §9cooling§f and §1active coolant§f. \n\nA §credstone signal§f applied to the §7Decelerator Controller§f will switch it on. When a Decelerator is switched on, the resulting particle's properties can be seen in the §2Accelerator GUI§r.\n\n\n§nOutput Particle Properties§r\n\nThe §bfocus§f gained or lost by a particle travelling through a Decelerator is calculated in exactly the same way as any other Accelerator.\n\nDecelerators §9lower§r the energy of particle inputs to a minimum of 0eV. However, they can only accept particle inputs with energies below their §6maximum energy§r. This maximum energy is calculated exactly the same way as the Synchrotron's §emaximum energy from Dipole Strength§r as discussed in the quest "Synchrotron Particle Properties".\n\nWhat this means is that the exact same design for a Synchrotron can be used for a Decelerator, as the §6maximum energy§f of the resultant Decelerator will be equal to the §emaximum energy from Dipole Strength§r of the §3Synchrotron§f.\n\n\n§nRedstone Control§r\n\nThe energy of the output particles is given by (15 - §cRedstone Signal Strength§r)/15 * §6Maximum Energy§r. This means that a signal strength of 15 lowers the energy to 0eV, while anything lower lowers the energy to a fraction of the maximum energy. This is useful for §aCollision Chamber recipes§r that require a very small non-zero §6energy§f, like §5anti-triton§f.
q.nuclearcraft_overh.nucleosynthesis_ch.name=Nucleosynthesis Chamber
q.nuclearcraft_overh.nucleosynthesis_ch.desc=The §7Nucleosynthesis Chamber§r fuses two elements together under a particle beam to create §enew elements§r!

Refinement of this material§r will require some pretty advanced multiblocks§f; check §2JEI§f to see what steps of particle collision you need to create the §5Tau§o§r and §5Anti-Tau§r particles, before putting them into a §7Neutral Containment Unit§r for storage in cells!\n\n§cTauonium requires the highest collision energy in the mod; you will need to accelerate protons to 150GeV to make Tauonium via Higgs decay. Good luck.§f\n\n§4Damage buffed:§r\n- Positronium: §650§r\n- Muonium: §6200§r\n- Tauonium: §6800§r
q.nuclearcraft_overh.beam_splitter.name=Beam Splitter
q.nuclearcraft_overh.beam_splitter.desc=§3Beam Splitters§r are almost exactly the same as §3Beam Diverters§r. However, the key difference is that they split beams instead of bending them. This can come in handy if you want to use a beam of exotic particles for multiple recipes in different multiblocks, or have a beam multiplication setup.\n\n\n§nConstruction§r\n\nA visualisation of a §3Beam Splitters§r can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki.§f \n\nBeam Splitters are constructed exactly the same as Beam Diverters, except they have §ntwo§r §coutput§r particle hatches for the two beams, and use a §7Beam Splitter Controller§r instead.\n\n\n§nRequirements§r\n\nBeam Splitters require §6power§r and §1active coolant§r, like all other accelerators. However, they do not require §9coolers§f.\n\nTo activate the Beam Splitter, simply give the Beam Splitter Controller a §credstone signal§f.\n\nBeam Splitters can only bend particle beams with energies below their §6maximum energy§.§r. This is dependent on the electromagnet used in the Dipole Magnet, with stronger electromagnets capable of bending higher energy beams. \n\n\n§nOutput Particle Properties§r\n\nIn the Beam Splitter, particle beams are split into two equal beams, each with §4half the amount§r of the original beam. They also lose §6energy§f and §bfocus§r, with the energy loss increasing as the particle beam's §6initial energy§f increases. Both the maximum energy and energy loss can be seen in the §2Beam Splitter GUI§r, while the §bfocus loss§r is calculated as per normal. \n\nMore details on the maximum energy and energy loss calculations can be found on the §2QMD Github Wiki§f.

q.nuclearcraft_overh.fission_fuels.desc=Using §e§risotopes§r, you can make §a§2LEU-235§r or §2HEU-235§r. Both fuels have differences in the amount of heat they produce, how long they last, and much more. These differences will be important when designing your reactor.\n\nBefore using them to fuel your reactor, however, they need to go through one last processing step. There are three different types of fuel you can make from §2§rBase Fuel§r: a §9Oxide§r, a §aNitride§r, or a §eZirconium Alloy§r. There is no "best" among these three types of fuel; each has its own benefits over the other. You can check the differences in your stats in the tooltips for each fuel. When building your reactor, be sure to choose the best fuel for your purposes.\n\n§9Oxygen§r and §aNitrogen§r can be obtained by processing compressed air, which is detailed in the quests above. These can also come from running Rockhounding gases through a transposer.\n\nIts data such as power generation factor and heating factor can be seen in its description in §2JEI§r or §2wiki§r\n\nAny fuel can be used to complete the quest.
