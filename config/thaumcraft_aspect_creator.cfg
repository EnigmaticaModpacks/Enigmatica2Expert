aspect_creation {
    # This is the list of custom aspects to add to Thaumcraft
    # Add one aspect per line. The format is: <name>;<color>;<aspect1>;<aspect2>
    # <name>: the name of the aspect. For example: "tempestas"
    # <color>: the int color of the aspect, for example 6495ED. Use a website like https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ to pick the color
    # <aspect1>: it is the first ingredient aspect. Should not be null
    # <aspect2>: it is the second ingredient aspect. Should not be null
    # A Complete example would be like this:
    # tempestas;0x4C2773;volatus;aqua
    # Note: for commodity, the string parser ignores tabs
    # Note: registration of aspects which depend of previously defined aspects is possible. Just include them before.
    # For example: 
    # ventus;0xXXYYZZ;aer;perditio
    # tempestas;0xAABBCC;aqua;ventus
    # Download icons in Thaumcraft style at https://game-icons.net/
    # Download them with white foreground and transparent background. Save as png and put it into your 
    # <minecraft instance folder>/resources/thaumcraftaspectcreator/textures/<name>.png
    # For the Tempestas aspect, it would be placed into <minecraft instance folder>/resources/thaumcraftaspectcreator/tempestas.png
    # Localize the aspect short description using the unlocalized string tc.aspect.<name>
    # (for example, add to en_us.lang the string "tc.aspect.tempestas=Storm, Turbolence"
