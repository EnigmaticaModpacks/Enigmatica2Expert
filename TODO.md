## Unused TC traits

-----------

- [x] darktraveler     | Surrounding mobs get randomly afflicted with damage.
- [x] hailhydra        | Random explosions plague your enemies. Also, when you are attacked, there is a chance to get Absorption.
- [x] hearts           | The higher your health, the more damage you do.
- [x] heavy_metal      | Increased knockback + Slowness on target.
- [x] illuminati       | While the tool is in your hand, nearby entities (that do not hold a tool with this trait) glow, and you become invisible.
- [x] morganlefay      | Bonus magic damage (ranging from 0.0 to 5.0; Gaussian distributed) is afflicted (it is absolute).
- [x] rudeawakening    | Damage pierces armor (mobs only).
- [x] spades           | The lower your health, the more damage you do.
- [x] starfishy        | Press the "set portal" key (default "N") to set a virtual portal on the block you are pointing at. If you are on the brink of death, you have %d enori crystals to spare, and the portal has enough space above, then the crystals are consumed, you are teleported to the virtual portal, and you are spared. (The tool must be in your hand.)
- [x] thundering       | Summon a thunderbolt on impact.
- [x] unnamed          | Bonus damage accrued for each entity of the same type as the target close to it.

- [x] barrett          | ❌ As health decreases, there is an increasing chance of a critical hit.
- [x] divineshield     | ❌ While this tool is in your hand, you are granted fire resistance. Also, damage is reduced, but at a durability cost.
- [x] dprk             | ❌ When attacking or defending, Supreme Leaders will spawn, exploding on opponents in the same manner as a creeper.
- [x] ghastly          | ❌ If the holder is attacked while sneaking, the attacker is inflicted with Slowness.
- [x] ignoble          | ❌ As one takes damage, one starts to harbor feelings of ignoble jealousy as the offender is killed. When this trait is enabled, those feelings are vented when attacking while sneaking.
